# React Counter App

## Project Overview
The **React Counter App** is a simple, interactive counter application built with React. It allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value. This project demonstrates the use of React hooks (useState) for managing state and showcases fundamental concepts of React component design and event handling.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For scripting and logic.
- **CSS (Optional)**: For styling (if any custom styles are added).

## Features
- **Increment Counter**: Increase the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement Counter**: Decrease the counter value by 1.
- **Reset Counter**: Reset the counter value to 0.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-counter-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.
3. Use the buttons to interact with the counter:
   - **Increment**: Increases the counter by 1.
   - **Reset**: Resets the counter to 0.
   - **Decrement**: Decreases the counter by 1.

## Code Structure
### Counter Component (`Counter.js`)
- Contains the main logic and state management using the `useState` hook.
- Provides buttons to increment, decrement, and reset the counter.

### App Component (`App.js`)
- Serves as the root component and displays the `Counter` component.

## Example Code
### `Counter.js`
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
    let [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
        <h1>{count}</h1>
        <button onClick={()=>{setCount(++count);}}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={()=>{setCount(0);}}>Reset</button>
        <button onClick={()=>{setCount(--count);}}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Counter;
```

### `App.js`
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Components/Counter';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className='main-container'>
       <h1>React Counter App</h1>
       <Counter></Counter>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
